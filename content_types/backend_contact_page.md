* Create a content type named "Contact Page".
* Delete any field it has.
* Create a node named "Contact" with the alias /contact.
* Create 3 basic blocks.
    * contact_opener
    * contact_number
    * contact_ender
* Filter each of these blocks to appear only in that content type.
* Sort blocks in "Content" region.

Then the phone number can appear anywhere backendly, without duplicating it (we just re-instantiate the block).
