I thought to utilize language detection to change the directionality of RTL-English to LTR-English but I was wrong.

* Language detection doesn't change text directionality of text at all.
* Language detection automatically switches to a readily-avilable manual-translation of a node (if there is one).
* Language detection will not merely change directionality to that different than the default one of the website.
