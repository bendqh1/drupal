I thought to utilize language detection to change the directionality of RTL-English to LTR-English but I was wrong.

* Language detection doesn't change node output directionality at all.
* Language detection automatically switches to a readily-avilable manual-translation of a node (even if there is one).

Besides that, Language Detection created robotic extra aliases for nodes. That was an aesthetic and SEO problem.
