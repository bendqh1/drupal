I thought to utilize language detection to change the directionality of RTL-English to LTR-English but I was wrong.

Language detection doesn't change text directionality of text at all.

It automatically switches to a readily-avilable manual-translation of a node (if there is one).

It will not merely change directionality to that different than the default one of the website.
