To test if you have Composer just type `composer` in terminal.

## Drupal installation

A typical Drupal project directory has two sub directories, `/web` and `/vendor`.

This means that the root of the project created with the Composer template is one level above the webroot.

A `/web` directory includes a Drupal website.

When Drush is installed with composer as part of a Drupal composer.json, then drush is installed in the vendor directory of that Drupal installation and upgrading drush is separate from upgrading drupal

## Version matches

The version of the PHP module for Composer and the version of the PHP module for the web server must match, so in shared server environments where different PHP modules have different versions; there must be such a match.

That being said; there isn't necessarily a must that the versions of both Composer AND web server would match the version of the PHP module for Drush.

So for example if both Composer and the web server reflect PHP 8.3.14 but Composer reflects 8.16, that's not necessarily a major problem.
