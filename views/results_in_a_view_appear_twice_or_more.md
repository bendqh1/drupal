Check that sort criteria is:

* **Sort criteria: Publishing date (descending)**

Instead of:

* **Sort criteria: Taxonomy term publishing date (descending)**

Choosing a sort criteria based on **a date in which the content was related to a term** will cause the number of results in each view to correspond with the number of taxonomy terms in the each node in this view.

## Notes

* Another reason for such a problem may be with translations filter criteria.
