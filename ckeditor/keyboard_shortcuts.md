## Question

In Drupal 11 I edit a node and I have a unordered list (`<ul>`) with four list items.

I want to indent the last three list items of the four, so to make them a sub-list.

How to do that with the keyboard?

Short answer.

## Answer

Place your cursor before each of the last three list items and press `Tab` â€” this will indent them and make them sub-items (i.e. create a nested `<ul>`).
