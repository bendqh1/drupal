## Only for blocks

### Question

In Drupal 11.1.2 or greater, I want to use the core module "Layout Builder" but only for blocks; not for any node or node type whatsoever; only and solely for blocks. Is this possible?

Short answer.

### Answer

Yes, it's possible. In Drupal 11.1.2 or greater, you can enable the "Layout Builder" module and configure it to only apply to blocks by disabling it for content types. This way, it will be available for use exclusively with blocks.
