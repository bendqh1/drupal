I have created a view of taxonomy terms with the terms filitered by published and sorted by random.

My problem is that this view block appears both in nodes and in taxonomy term pages while I need it to appear in taxonomy term pages alone.

If I could, I would filter the view by URL relative path /taxonomy/term/ but I didn't find such a filter cirteria.

How to prevent a view of taxonomy term to appear in nodes?

By the way I areadly went to Advanced > Relationships > Content with Term and filtered by content type and then choose not equals (all content types) but this didn't help because then no taxonomy terms appeard at all, not even in /taxonomy/term/ pages, so I have canceled this relationship altogether
