This can replace the field of taxonomy tags, and give us block-control over that field's content, per node.

1. Create a taxonomy view.
2. Create **relations** with nodes with at least one term.
3. Create a **contextual filter** by `content ID` (NID) and choose to give it a **default value** which is a `serial number from the URL`.
