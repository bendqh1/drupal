I wish that any `term` will have a prefix like `articles in the topic of`, so to get:

`Articles in the topic of term`.

How to do that?

Answer:

Configure contextual filter: Content: Has taxonomy term ID

When the filter value is in the URL or a default is provided

Override title:

מאמרים בנושא {{ arguments.tid }}
