## Changing the name of a taxonomy term

I have a taxonomy term named **A** in about 25 nodes and I want to change its name to **B**.

My problem is that opening node after node and manually changing **A** to **B** in each of the the 25 nodes is inefficient and there is probably a better way to do some bulk change so the name **B** will appear in all of these nodes instead the name **A**.

Just go to the taxonomy term page and change its name from **A** to **B**.
