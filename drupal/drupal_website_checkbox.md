Important things.

1. Ensure that a clickable phone number is in `example.com/contact`.
2. Ensure that the phone number is clickable anywhere. 
3. Check that all channels for contact are in working.
4. Check that taxonomy term pages include links to all webpages sharing that taxonomy term --------- and if they don't, enable or retrieve the View that causes them to do so

Remind youself that natively, in Drupal ,there is at least one taxonomy term vocabulary and that this vocabulary has zero taxonomy terms in it but can have more.
