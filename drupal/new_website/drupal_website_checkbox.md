Important things.

1. Ensure that a clickable phone number is in `example.com/contact`.
2. Ensure that the phone number is clickable anywhere. 
3. Check that all channels for contact are working.
4. Check that taxonomy term pages include links to all webpages sharing that taxonomy term --- and if they don't, enable or retrieve the View that causes them to do so

In Drupal ,there is at least one native taxonomy term vocabulary and that this vocabulary has zero taxonomy terms in it but can have one or more.
