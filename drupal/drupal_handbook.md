Drupal uncustomized core 9.5.3 upgraded to 9.5.9 (first version was probably 9.4.5).

I thought that a node has a taxonomy term but the taxonomy-term-webpage doesn't mention this node.<br>
I believed that this problem is part of a broader problem in which taxonomy-term-webpages don't have h1 headings.

I was wrong.<br>
the taxonomy-term-page did mentioned this node.<br>
I didn't notice that due to it having only one value, the value text was very generic and short `תכנים אחרונים` and no link styling was directly apparent.
